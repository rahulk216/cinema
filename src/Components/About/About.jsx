					Having grown up in a household that lived and breathed movies,
					I’ve always had an inclination towards cinema. When every aspect
					of film production piqued my interest, I decided I no longer
					wanted to be just a viewer. I wanted to be a creator.
				</p>
				<p>
					My romance with cameras took off around the same time my interest
					in engineering wore off. As cliche as it sounds, after watching
					the movie Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, my inspiration kindled. I
					pursued Mass Media and bought an entry-level DSLR. Early into
					college, I worked with a theatre group and polished my
					photography skills. I loved capturing frames and people in
					action. Eventually, I started making short films for college
					festivals and projects, and later for my own independent
					production. Since then, I've never looked back. I went on to
					finish my Cinematography studies from Mindscreen Film Institute
					in Chennai under the guidance of Rajiv Menon ISC.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, holding more than four years of expertise and freelancing, I
					have worked as a Director of Photography, 2nd Unit DP and Camera
					Operator on various film and commercial projects. My works have
					travelled to several Indian & International Film Festivals. I
					believe that I bring visual clarity, technique and a distinct
					storytelling to any project that I'm associated with.
