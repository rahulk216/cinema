								Having grown up in a household that lived and breathed
								movies, I’ve always had an inclination towards cinema.
								When every aspect of film production piqued my interest,
								I decided I no longer wanted to be just a viewer. I
								wanted to be a creator.
							</p>
							<p>
								My romance with cameras took off around the same time my
								interest in engineering wore off. As cliche as it
								sounds, after watching the movie Yeh Jawaani Hai
								Deewani, my inspiration kindled. I pursued Mass Media
								and bought an entry-level DSLR. Early into college, I
								worked with a theatre group and polished my photography
								skills.

								I loved capturing frames and people in action.
								Eventually, I started making short films for college
								festivals and projects, and later for my own independent
								production. Since then, I've never looked back. I went
								on to finish my Cinematography studies from Mindscreen
								Film Institute in Chennai under the guidance of Rajiv
								Menon ISC.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, holding more than four years of expertise and
								freelancing, I have worked as a Director of Photography,
								2nd Unit DP and Camera Operator on various film and
								commercial projects. My works have travelled to several
								Indian & International Film Festivals. I believe that I
								bring visual clarity, technique and a distinct
								storytelling to any project that I'm associated with.
